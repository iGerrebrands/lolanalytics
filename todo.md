# Todo


- Create an refresh option for summoner to sync data with riot api (we do also need to check the regio maby we need to enrich the object we get from riot 
  with an regio attribute) 
- remove spaces summoner name in backend before doing request to the riot api
- Let users choose between REGIO:
  - On add summoner: We have to add the regio on request.
- Make the more info page for summoners ( ranked info in there etc... )
- In games '0' kill/deaths/assists wont show
